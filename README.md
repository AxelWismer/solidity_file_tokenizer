# File tokenizer in solidity

A simple application that allows you to digitally sign files and store these signatures on the blockchain. It also allows you to transfer the ownership of the files through the ERC721 (NFT) protocol.

## Development path:
- [x] Create a smart contract that tokenizes a file, saving only its name and hash on the blockchain.
- [ ] Create a front-end app that hashes a file and saves it to the blockchain.
- [ ] Add queries for the saved files and allow checking if a file was modified.Â 
- [ ] Allow the transfer of file tokens using the ERC721 protocol.
