# File tokenizer in solidity

A simple application that allows you to digitally sign files and store these signatures on the blockchain. It also allows you to transfer the ownership of the files through the ERC721 (NFT) protocol.

Development path:
- Tokenize a file, saving only its hash on the blockchain.
- Query saved files and check if a file was modified.Â 
- Allow the transfer of file tokens using the ERC721 protocol.
